Here's a thread where you can ask questions, tell stories, or hurl insults at one of my favorite amateur bands, if not my favorite - 6 meters! For starters, from Wikipedia: gt The 6-meter band is a portion of the very high frequency (VHF) radio spectrum allocated to amateur radio use. Although located in the lower portion of the VHF band, it nonetheless occasionally displays propagation mechanisms characteristic of the high frequency (HF) bands. This normally occurs close to sunspot maximum. Страница разработчика — Fonlow  все найденные приложения: KP Typing Tutor Разработчик: Fonlow. Update 4/9/19: Since a few people have asked.
